```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(jsonlite)
# Create a variable of your API key
api_key <- 'YVFTG9TOUYRONOBMM'

# Store the name of your band in a variable
band <- 'Bombay Bicycle Club'

# Creat another variable that replaces your spaces with +'s (hint: gsub)
band_no_spaces <- gsub(' ', '+', band)

# Write a query to get the first biography of your band on echonest
# See: http://developer.echonest.com/docs/v4/artist.html#biographies
bio_base <- 'http://developer.echonest.com/api/v4/artist/biographies?api_key='
bio_url <- paste0(bio_base, api_key, '&name=', band_no_spaces, '&results=1')

# Use the fromJSON command to retrieve your data, and store the text of the first biography in a variable
bio <- fromJSON(bio_url)
bio_text <- bio$response$biographies$text

# Run another query to get band images: see: http://developer.echonest.com/docs/v4/artist.html#images
### Warning: you may get an error message if the image is not available -- check online that it exists!
image_base <- 'http://developer.echonest.com/api/v4/artist/images?api_key='
image_url <- paste0(image_base, api_key, '&name=', gsub(' ', '+', band_no_spaces), '&results=1')

# Use the fromJSON command to retrieve your data, and store the url of the first image in a variable
image_results <- fromJSON(image_url)
include_image <- image_results$response$images$url

# Outside of this code section, write the (R)Markdown syntax that:
# - States the name of your band
# - Displays the bio you just retrieved 
# - Shows the image of your band

### Bonus ###
# Make another request, and retrieve/display the band's top songs
# Wrap the above steps in a function that takes a band as a parameter, and returns the desired info
```

Here's a bio I found on `r band`:

>`r bio$response$biographies$text`

And here's a photo!
