Here's a bio I found on Bombay Bicycle Club:

>Bombay Bicycle Club are a band which formed in North London, United Kingdom in 2006 by Jack Steadman (vocals, guitar, bass), Jamie MacColl (bass, guitar, banjo, vocals), Suren De Saram (drums) under the name of The Canals when they were 15. Ed Nash (bass, keyboard, mandolin) later joined the trio as they switched between various aliases before picking Bombay Bicycle Club. The band took their name from a chain of curry houses in the London Area and have released four studio albums, "I Had the Blues But I Shook Them Loose" (2009), "Flaws" (2010), "A Different Kind of Fix" (2011) and "So Long, See You Tomorrow" (2014).  After winning the opening slot at V Festival 2006 ('Road to V' competition) and also played Reading / Leeds Festival for the three years running, in Febuary 2007 they released their d√©but EP The Boy I Used to Be. This was followed up in October with the release of their second EP How We Are. In mid-July of 2009 they released their first album I Had the Blues But I Shook Them Loose consisting of 12 tracks. The album peaked at number 46 on the UK Official Album Charts.  In Summer 2010 they released their second album, Flaws . A UK tour co-incided with the release of the album which - surprisingly - is an acoustic recording. Venues on the tour reflected this new acoustic orientation, which gained them a number 8 on the album charts.  The lead single from their third album, A Different Kind of Fix was released on June 23, 2011 and peaked at  #40 on the Billboard Alternative Songs chart in the United States, the band's first chart appearance in the country. The album reached the number 6 position on the UK album charts.   The band added Amber Wilson to their live party as an additional keyboardist and background vocalist. Singer/songwriter Lucy Rose also joined the live performances on vocals, after featuring on several songs from the albums "Flaws" and "A Different Kind of Fix".  On November 5th, 2013 "Carry Me" was released as an advance of their fourth studio album through Island Records. "Luna" was the second single to be extracted from the album "So Long, See You Tomorrow" which coveted the band their first UK number 1.
